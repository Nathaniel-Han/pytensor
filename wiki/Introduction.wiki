Tensors, also known as n-way arrays/ multi-dimensional arrays are widely used in various data-mining applications. Combined with the easy representation of multi-dimensional datta, tensor algebra offers a powerful means to organize, represent and visualize complex data. In this section, we provide a brief overview of how tensors can be used in the context of representing molecular dynamics trajectory data as well as how one can construct tensors out of them.
