Tensors, also known as n-way arrays/ multi-dimensional arrays are widely used in various data-mining applications. Combined with the easy representation of multi-dimensional datta, tensor algebra offers a powerful means to organize, represent and visualize complex data. In this section, we provide a brief overview of how tensors can be used in the context of representing molecular dynamics trajectory data as well as how one can construct tensors out of them. 

Formally, a  tensor $\mathcal{X}$ of
$M$ dimensions can be defined as a multi-dimensional array of real
values,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{X} \in \Re^{N_{1} \times N_{2} \times \hdots \times N_{M}}
\end{equation}
where $N_{i}$ represents the $i^{th}$ dimension for $(1 \leq i \leq
M)$.  A discussion of possible operations on a tensor is beyond the
scope of this report, however, a review of tensors and related
operations are provided in Kolda, et al~\cite{Kolda_2007}. In what
follows, tensors are represented with calligraphic letters (e.g.
$\mathcal{X}$), matrices by bold capital letters(e.g. $\textbf{X}$),
vectors as bold small letters ($\textbf{x}$) and specific instances
as normal text ($x$).
